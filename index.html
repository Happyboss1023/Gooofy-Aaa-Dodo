        <h1>Headteacher's Welcome</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Boston Grammar School is a successful and forward looking community. For four hundred and sixty years we have been a centre of excellence at the heart of Boston. As we move further into the twenty first century we are determined to respond to the demands of an ever changing world, whilst retaining our core values – care, achievement, respect and excellence.

            The people involved with Boston Grammar School are what make it so special. Our pupils are exemplary! Their behaviour is impeccable and they are the school’s best ambassadors. Similarly, the team of dedicated teachers and support staff, working in partnership with parents and governors, aims to provide an outstanding education for all our pupils. We are a conscientious group of professionals, always striving to give of our very best.
            
            Our traditions, including the Charter Day Service, Beast Mart ceremony, Remembrance Service and annual Prize Giving are valued by all - our students are very protective of each and every one. With this great history, we are determined to go from strength to strength, to serve Boston and the local community for many hundreds of years to come.
            
            The school is proud of its success in the traditional, academic GCSE and A-level subjects, with the vast majority of our students going on to university. The school is unique in offering up to a dozen bursaries each year to students entering Higher Education, after successfully completing their A-level courses with Boston Grammar School. The Medlock Trust, Dora Stanley and Durham Castle Scholarships are significant and have proven invaluable in helping our students succeed at university. Past students have pursued careers in engineering, medicine, law, politics, architecture, media, banking and the sciences but many of those joining BGS now will enter professions and jobs which do not currently exist. This is why we are encouraging our students to develop a lifelong passion for learning. We aim to help them become resilient, adaptable and confident.
            
            One of the school's key strengths is the pastoral support in place. The Form Tutor, Head of Year and the Assistant Headteacher responsible for student welfare are central figures in ensuring that each child receives the care and support they need to succeed. All students are also members of the school’s House system which encourages them to participate and compete in a wide range of activities. Education should be fun and we aim to make our students’ school careers as enjoyable as possible.
            
            We are proud of the many extra-curricular opportunities on offer at BGS. The Grammar Gazette claims to be the longest running school newspaper in the country, whilst the 'Theories of Everything' club covers ideas such as 'black holes' and 'string theory'. These are but two of many of the clubs which exist. The school remains committed to 'caring' for all and not just our own community. We continue to raise thousands of pounds for good causes every year. Our work as an 'International School' has included trips and exchanges to numerous European countries. On top of this, since September 2014, BGS has developed formal partnerships with schools in Saarbrucken, Germany and Normandy, France. We are constantly looking for ways to broaden our pupils' horizons and encourage them to be responsible global citizens.
            
            With able and motivated pupils, and a dedicated team of staff, our school encourages all talents, creates a purposeful environment in which to learn, and provides opportunities for the spiritual, moral, cultural and social development of all our students. We hope that all prospective students and parents will visit us and experience the school for themselves. We are a caring and respectful community, with a determined focus on achievement for all.

        <h1>The History of The School</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <br>
        <p>One of the things which Boston Grammar School is most valued for is its history and values based on traditions. There is a great deal of interest from the local community in the school's history. The school was given a Royal Charter in 1555 and it has stood on its current site since 1568. In the 1980s 'Floreat Bostona' was written by G.S.Bagley and published by the OBA. This book examines the history of the town of Boston and places emphasis on Boston Grammar School.

            Much of the information that features on these pages is based on the work of Bagley and also from the members of the Old Boys Association who have worked tenaciously to undertake research on Boston Grammar School.</p>

        <p>Charter Day
            Philip and Mary's 1554 Charter explained their desire for Boston to have "good Education of the Youth and Children." In the reception area of the school you will see a replica of our Charter, in Latin. It is really a set of letters patent from Philip and Mary, bequeathing land for "the finding, maintaining and establishing, for ever, a Free Grammar school in Boston, and a fit master to teach, instruct and serve in the said School for the Education and Instruction of Boys and Youth in Grammar….".
            
            We commemorate this event every Autumn with a celebration of the granting of the school charter. As indicated above, it was really the royal seal of approval from Philip and Mary in 1555 that bequeathed the land on which we stand to Boston and guaranteed the existence of a grammar school.
            
            The Charter Day is a big occasion every year for the school and it is always uplifting to see the whole school walk through the town to St Botolph's Church, a wonderful venue for a service celebrating the history of the school and its place in the community. The service itself involves a mixture of organ playing, readings, choral singing, musical performances, hymns and addresses. Parents are warmly welcomed to join us for this fine old school tradition.
            
            
            
            
            Beast Mart
            Perhaps the most unusual of celebrations, this is an event peculiar to our school, arising from the fascinating history of Boston Grammar School. When the Marquess of Northampton was thrown into the Tower for his part in trying to secure Mary Tudor's throne for Lady Jane Grey, the Boston Corporation lobbied the Crown for the return of his land that fell in former guild lands belonging to them. The Corporation was successful, and in 1555 the land "in which is kept a grammar school (scola litteratoris) with the appurtenances" returned to the people of Boston by letters patent of Philip and Mary. With the Elizabethan statesman Lord Burghley as the town's recorder, the school flourished and occupied its current site with the building that you still see today in 1567. In 1588, the year of the Armada, the town's fair and cattle market moved from Bargate to the school yard (the Mart Yard). For a time it became one of the most important fairs in the East Midlands, only moving back to Wide Bargate during the 19th Century.
            
            Nowadays, there are no cows, but we celebrate the tradition of the opening of the Mart annually. In most years we gather out in the December cold in the Beast Yard as a school to listen to the declaration of the opening of the Mart. At the stroke of noon, by the chime of the clock of St Botolph's, the Mayor calls for a half-day holiday to be granted to the pupils of the school. Each year, the Head grants that request (except, of course, for boys who owe coursework, who have the pleasure of spending the afternoon's holiday working in the Library). The vast majority of pupils go home happily. In 2010, for the first time in a very long time, the Beast Yard was so ice-bound that the service took place in the Library, with the prefects representing the pupil body.
            
            
            
            Prize Giving
            An annual prizegiving ceremony is held in December of each year. During this event a number of awards recognising achievement in academic disciplines, sport and other areas are awarded. Old boys are often in attendance, including the previous year's A-level students who return to receive their A-level certificates. The prestigious Parry Gold Medal is awarded to the student who achieved the best A-level results. A guest speaker is always invited, and notable guests of honour have included Professor Jonathan Van-Tam MBE, Danny Butterfield, Helen Sharman, Barry Spikings and Mark Simmonds MP.</p>
